Important Release notes
-----------------------

-    [Windows only] If upgrading to 1.10.4 from earlier release : please uninstall Jajuk first as the installer changed (your collection will remain unchanged).
-    Jajuk requires Java 1.6 to run
-    A deep refresh will be proposed to you to take into account changes to tags and album covers if you upgrade from a pre-1.9 release. You can perform it manually from Devices view / right click / Force Refresh / Deep.
-    [Windows or OSX in Web Start mode] The first startup will take a while (in the "Initial checkups" step), as the required mplayer executable is downloaded
-    [Linux] It is strongly recommended to install mplayer if not already done to support every audio formats and to get a better sound.
